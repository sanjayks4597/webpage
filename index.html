                <p>Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators; however, learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings, and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.

                    Formal education is commonly divided formally into stages such as preschool or kindergarten, primary school, secondary school and then college, university, or apprenticeship. In most regions, education is compulsory up to a certain age.</p>

            <h3>Transforming education in India</h3>
            <p> India is known for being the place of one of the most ancient civilizations in the world. In ancient India, religion was the mainspring of all activities. It majorly consisted of prayer and worship, philosophy, morality, and law.

                The period of Guptas and Harsha and their successors is remarkable in Indian history. It was the age of the emergence of the universities of Nalanda and Takshila and the rise of Indian sciences, mathematics, and astronomy. The university at Nalanda housed a population of several thousand teachers and students, who were maintained, out of the revenues from more than 100 villages. The education in these universities covered the Vedas, logic, grammar, astronomy, medicine, psychology, Buddhist philosophy, and Hindu philosophy.
                
                Eventually the Vedic tradition was later followed even during the Mughal as well as the British rule. While during the Mughal rule, the major educational practices were based on the Islamic ideologies, during the British rule, Christian missionary schools were opened.</p>
